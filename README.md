# Industrial Copper Modeling  

This project focuses on developing predictive models and a user-friendly interface for the copper industry to analyze and classify data effectively. The main objectives include:  

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns such as `material_ref`.  

2. **Regression Models:**  
   - Predicting the selling prices of copper items based on relevant features.  

3. **Classification Models:**  
   - Classifying item statuses (Types A, B, C) using advanced machine learning algorithms.  

4. **Streamlit GUI Implementation:**  
   - An intuitive interface for users to input data and view predictions seamlessly.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   - Comprehensive evaluation of models for optimal performance.
